Javascript implementation of the memory game Simon. The player must attempt to match a randomly-generated sequence of button-presses, which grows incrementally longer with each successive round.

The game can be won by completing twenty rounds. A strict mode option can be enabled that causes the game to restart if the player makes an incorrect input at any point.
